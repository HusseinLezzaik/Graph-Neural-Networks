DGL Graph Construction

By the end of this tutorial you will be able to:

* Construct a graph in DGL from scratch

* Assign node and edge features to a graph

* Query properties of a DGL graph such as node degrees and connectivity

* Transform a DGL graph into another graph

* Load and save DGL graphs

" Construct a directed star graph with 5 leaves. The center nodeâ€™s ID is 0. The edges go from the center node to the leaves."

g = dgl.graph(([0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]), num_nodes=6)

# Equivalently, PyTorch LongTensors also work.
g = dgl.graph((torch.LongTensor([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), torch.LongTensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])), num_nodes=6)

# You can omit the number of nodes argument if you can tell the number of nodes from the edge list alone.
g = dgl.graph(([0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))

" Print the source and destination nodes of every edge "
print(g.edges())

" Assigning Node and Edge Features to Graph "

# Assign a 3-dimensional node feature vector for each node.
g.ndata['x'] = torch.randn(6, 3)
# Assign a 4-dimensional edge feature vector for each edge.
g.edata['a'] = torch.randn(5, 4)
# Assign a 5x4 node feature matrix for each node.  Node and edge features in DGL can be multi-dimensional.
g.ndata['y'] = torch.randn(6, 5, 4)

print(g.edata['a'])

" Querying Graph Structures "

print(g.num_nodes())
print(g.num_edges())
# Out degrees of the center node
print(g.out_degrees(0))
# In degrees of the center node - note that the graph is directed so the in degree should be 0.
print(g.in_degrees(0))

" Graph Transformations "

# Induce a subgraph from node 0, node 1 and node 3 from the original graph.
sg1 = g.subgraph([0, 1, 3])
# Induce a subgraph from edge 0, edge 1 and edge 3 from the original graph.
sg2 = g.edge_subgraph([0, 1, 3])
# The original IDs of each node in sg1
print(sg1.ndata[dgl.NID])
# The original IDs of each edge in sg1
print(sg1.edata[dgl.EID])
# The original IDs of each node in sg2
print(sg2.ndata[dgl.NID])
# The original IDs of each edge in sg2
print(sg2.edata[dgl.EID])

# The original node feature of each node in sg1
print(sg1.ndata['x'])
# The original edge feature of each node in sg1
print(sg1.edata['a'])
# The original node feature of each node in sg2
print(sg2.ndata['x'])
# The original edge feature of each node in sg2
print(sg2.edata['a'])

newg = dgl.add_reverse_edges(g)
newg.edges()

" Loading and Saving Graphs "
# Save graphs
dgl.save_graphs('graph.dgl', g)
dgl.save_graphs('graphs.dgl', [g, sg1, sg2])

# Load graphs
(g,), _ = dgl.load_graphs('graph.dgl')
print(g)
(g, sg1, sg2), _ = dgl.load_graphs('graphs.dgl')
print(g)
print(sg1)
print(sg2)
