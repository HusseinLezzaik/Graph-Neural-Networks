# Graph Neural Networks - Classification/Regression

## Requirements
1. Install PyTorch from [here](https://pytorch.org/)
2. Run the following command to install additional dependencies:
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

You also need to download the Deep Graph Library (DGL) from [here](https://docs.dgl.ai/install/index.html). It works fine with Ubunut 20.04.
